# Multi Color Buttons

## Tasks

1. The first row contains a button that will jump if you click it. The jumping part is missing from the code so you need to write it. So when someone clicks the button, it goes from the right to the left and the button's text changes to `Go Left!`.  When we click again it goes to the left and the text changes to `Go Right!`.
    - When the button is on the left side, the text on it is `Go Right!`
    - When the button is on the left side, when we click it goes to the window's right side
    - When the button is on the right side, the text on it is `Go Left!`
    - When the button is on the right side, when we click it, it goes to the window's left side

2. The next row contains a button that changes his color when clicked.
    - When the button `Change my color!` is clicked, the button background is changing to red
    - When the button is clicked again, the button background changes back to default

3. In the next row you need to change the button `Click the other button` background color  when we click the button `Change my neighbour color!`
    - When we click the button `Change my neighbour color!`, the button `Click the other button` background color changes to a random color

4. The next row contains a button with a number. Whenever you click that button the number will raise on it.
    - If we click the button which has a number on, the number will raise by one on each click
